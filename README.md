# BEER_task

***A tiny remark about this mini-project***

To put it short, the task was to 'pack' the beer order into the beer packs (boxes) of specific sizes.


This task wasn't that easy as it seemed at the first glance. To make it right (and make it working) it grew to a little project.
It is also a little awkward construction of List<Map<Whatever, Whatever>> for what we are trying to achieve, so there are 
some places that may seem 'not right'. So please don't misjudge me, that was in the task.
